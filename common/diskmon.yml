    # Disk Space Monitoring during the build
    # Monitor the disk space during the build. If there is less that 1GB of space or less
    # than 100K inodes in any key build location (TMPDIR, DL_DIR, SSTATE_DIR), gracefully
    # shutdown the build. If there is less than 100MB or 1K inodes, perform a hard halt
    # of the build. The reason for this is that running completely out of space can corrupt
    # files and damages the build in ways which may not be easily recoverable.
    # It's necessary to monitor /tmp, if there is no space left the build will fail
    # with very exotic errors.
